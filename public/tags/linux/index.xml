      <description>Welcome to another Hack the Box writeup today we will be doing OpenAdmin.
OpenAdmin is a retired Linux box which has been rated easy and is part of the intro to dante Track.
Lets jump right in!
Recon After starting the box we get the ip as 10.10.10.171 and as always I start with nmap to scan for open ports and services running on them.
As we can see from the results we have two ports open, port 80 for HTTP and port 22 for ssh.</description>
