      <description>This will be my dive into writeups on boxes from Hack The Box.
Heist is a retired windows box which has been rated easy and is part of the intro to dante Track.
Lets jump right in!
Recon After starting the box we get the ip as 10.10.10.149 and as always I start with nmap to scan for open ports and services running on them.
I ran into a few problems with Nmap so I rescanned the machine with rustscan which got me all the open ports.</description>
