      <description>This is will my dive into writeups on boxes from Hack The Box.
Heist is a windows box which has been rated easy and is part of the intro to dante Track. Lets jump right in!
Recon After starting the box we get the ip as 10.10.10.149 and as always we start with nmap to scan for open ports and services running on them.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got smb,a web server runing IIS and winrm running.</description>
