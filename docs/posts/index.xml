            <description>This is will be my dive into writeups on boxes from Hack The Box.
Heist is a windows box which has been rated easy and is part of the intro to dante Track. Lets jump right in!
Recon After starting the box we get the ip as 10.10.10.149 and as always we start with nmap to scan for open ports and services running on them.
I ran into a few problems with Nmap so i rescanned the machine with rustscan which got me all the open ports.</description>

<p>Heist is a windows box which has been rated easy and is part of the <strong>intro to dante</strong> Track.
Lets jump right in!</p>
<h2 id="recon">Recon</h2>
<p>After starting the box we get the ip as <strong>10.10.10.149</strong> and as always we start with nmap to scan for open ports and services running on them.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/nmapscan.png" alt="Nmap_results"></p>
<p>I ran into a few problems with Nmap so i rescanned the machine with rustscan which got me all the open ports.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/rustscan.png" alt="rustscan"></p>
<h2 id="web-enumeration">Web Enumeration</h2>
<p>Navigating to <strong>10.10.10.149:80</strong> we get a login page.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/port80.png" alt="Login"></p>
<p>Trying to login prompts us to enter an email address,i decide to try and log in as guest and we get something interesting.</p>
<p>Instead of a login or registration page we&rsquo;re redirected to a support page containing a thread about someone named <strong>Hazard</strong> who has attached part of a cisco config file.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/supportpage.png" alt="Guest_login"></p>
<p>Clicking on the attachment opens it in the browser and we see password hashes and usernames.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/cisco_config.png" alt="AttachmentFile"></p>
<p>I use John the Ripper with the format set to <strong>md5crypt</strong> to crack the Type 5 password.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/password5crack.png" alt="type5"></p>
<p>For the type 7 password hashes i use a custom perl script to decrypt them.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/password7crack.png" alt="type7"></p>
<h2 id="smb-enumeration">Smb Enumeration</h2>
<p>In the support thread <strong>Hazard</strong> asked the support admin to create an account for him on the server, so using the decrypted credentials i try to access the shares.</p>
<p>Using <strong>Hazard: stealth1agent</strong> we are able to authenticate however, we are only able to list the shares and we can neither mount or access them.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/smbshares.png" alt="smb_shares"></p>
<p>Since we have rpc on the windows box i enumerate other users using impackets&rsquo; <strong>lookupsid</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/enum_users.png" alt="enum_users"></p>
<h2 id="winrm-enumeration">Winrm enumeration</h2>
<p>Since we also have winrm,using evil-winrm i try and see which user and credential work, after a few tries im able to authenticate as <strong>chase : Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d</strong> .</p>
<p>Poking around i see two interesting files in the Desktop directory <strong>todo.txt</strong> and <strong>user.txt</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>todo.txt</strong> contains some hints which we will use later.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/evilwinrm_access.png" alt="evil_winrm"></p>
<p><strong>user.txt</strong> contains the user flag hash which we submit.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/userflag.png" alt="user_flag"></p>
<p>Moving back to the <strong>todo.txt</strong> file we can see some list of things to do some of which are already done and some which aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>We can see Chase needs to keep checking the issues list and supposed to fix a route config hence i come to the conclusion he is the support admin.</p>
<p>He will be monitoring the issues list website via browser so i decide to check the processes running and i see firefox.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/firefox_process.png" alt="firefox_process"></p>
<p>I upload both procdump64.exe and strings64.exe from the sysinternals suite to the machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/upload_procdump.png" alt="procdump"></p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/upload_strings.png" alt="strings"></p>
<p>Using procdump.exe i dump one of the firefox processes and extract strings from it to another file using strings64.exe.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/dump_firefox.png" alt="dump_firefox"></p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/dump_strings.png" alt="dump_strings"></p>
<p>I then searched for the string <strong>login_password</strong> from the txt file and found a password.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/admin_pass.png" alt="admin_pass"></p>
<p>From the user enumeration we saw an administrator account,tying the credentials we&rsquo;ve gotten with it we are successful and on the desktop we find <strong>root.txt</strong> which contains the admin flag hash.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/heist/flaghash.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I Submitted the hash and completed the box.</p>
<p>You can get Sysinternals Suite <a href="https://live.sysinternals.com/">HERE</a></p>
<p>I had a lot of fun doing this box and writeup, I really hope you enjoyed the read.</p>
<p>Happy hacking everyone ðŸ˜Ž and as we say at f334aks-mini #IWDWD ðŸ’€</p>

            <description>This was one of the CTFs that started off the year and it was an online jeopardy style Capture the Flag (CTF) competition hosted by the Knight Squad community from Bangladesh.
The CTF started on 20 January 2022 09:00PM GMT +6 and ended on 21 January 2022 11:59PM GMT +6.
I participated under team @Fr334aks-mini and we managed pos 120 out of 752 teams with 2750 points.
I focused primarily on the forensic and steganography categories and managed to solve 4 challenges,2 from each category.</description>

<p>I focused primarily on the forensic and steganography categories and managed to solve 4 challenges,2 from each category.</p>
<h2 id="forensics">Forensics</h2>
<h3 id="lets-walk-together">Lets walk Together</h3>
<p>Find the flag from the following: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wjBWBjz2e_DxgSNvD-j5vXoKahZiVfLR">Download Link</a>.</p>
<p>First thing i always do whenever i get an image is to run file and strings on the image file in order to check that file extension matches the file type and to check to see if any hints appear from the strings in the file.
In this case the output from strings showed a flag.txt hinting towards a file being embedded in the image.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/forenchll4.png" alt="chall"></p>
<p>I decided to use foremost to extract the file from the image and got a zip file.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/foremost.png" alt="foremost"></p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/lsout.png" alt="ls"></p>
<p>Tried unzipping the file but it needed a password,i cracked it using fcrackzip and the rockyou.txt wordlist got the password and extracted the file and got the flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/crack2.png" alt="crack"></p>
<h2 id="unknown-file">Unknown File</h2>
<p>Find the flag from the following: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bNDZ_csIPx_hG0_ou1WgL884aEpMajSe">Download Link</a></p>
<p>As i always do i ran file on the file and it ws identified as data. That stumped me for a while till i decided to view it in hexdump and noticed the file had IHDR and IEND chunks so i knew that it was an image.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/IHDR.png" alt="ihdr">
<img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/IEND.png" alt="iend"></p>
<p>On investigating the IEND chunk further i noticed the end chunk value <strong>49 45 4E 44 AE 42 60 82</strong> was that of a png image.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/iendhex.png" alt="iendhex"></p>
<p>I researched a bit about fixing png headers and found this tool <a href="https://github.com/sherlly/PCRT.git">PCRT</a> that automatically fixes the headers.I added a png extension to the file and the tool automatically fixed it.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/PCRT.png" alt="pcrt"></p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/output2.png" alt="output2"></p>
<h2 id="steganography">Steganography</h2>
<h3 id="filed">FileD</h3>
<p>Find the Flag from the following: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tZi4QQhxGWJBIQB62-1zjU5jiGG97OQG">Download Link</a></p>
<p>On downloading you get a file with a .kra extension,i have never seen such an extension before so i immediately googled about it and found this site <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/kra">KRA File</a> which explained that the file was an image created by the application Krita Image viewer.</p>
<p>It is provided as an appimage, hence you just download it give it execution permissions and run it.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/krita.png" alt="krita"></p>
<p>Opening the image using the application showed the image itself and in a separate pane showed the layers that the image had.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/layers.png" alt="layers"></p>
<p>I went about deleting each layer till i got to the flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/rightlayer.png" alt="rightlayers">
<img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/flag.png" alt="flag"></p>
<h3 id="follow-the-white-rabbit">Follow The White Rabbit</h3>
<p>Find the Flag from the following: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NSPLcRnbhdwYdaNttpvidJ2RiaPxk0rR">Download Link</a></p>
<p>We get an image with a rabbit, however when you look at it closer you see a series of dashes and fullstops.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/whiterabbit.jpg" alt="whiterabbit"></p>
<p>I immediately knew it was morse code and went about decoding it with <a href="https://morsedecoder.com/">Morse Decoder</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/morse.png" alt="morse"></p>
<p>The decoded text was to be placed in <strong>KCTF{}</strong> and submitted as the flag.</p>
<h3 id="qr-code-from-the-future">QR Code From The Future</h3>
<p>Challenge file can be found here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TDizwDbBhBR1bz9LYYqBrDL6cUtrMqEV">Download Link</a></p>
<p>I did solve this challenge but not before the flag was submitted by the team captain Winter.</p>
<p>This challenge really gve me a headache,it was a git that contained qrcodes.</p>
<p>I ran strings,binwalk, foremost and all i hit were dead ends till i decided to stop thinking along the lines of &ldquo;There must be a file or text embedded in it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since it was a gif but contained qrcode i decided to scan it but each and every time i scanned the qrcode i got a different letter which was when i realized these were multiple qrcodes in the gif.</p>
<p>I researched a bit and found a site which extracted each frame and saved them as images in a zip making it easier to work with the qrcodes <a href="https://ezgif.com/split">EZgif</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/gif.png" alt="morse"></p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/zip.png" alt="morse"></p>
<p>I now had a new problem, i had 48 different images and i shuddered to think that i was going to have to manually load them into a qrcode scanner so i created 2 python scripts, one to decode the qrcodes in bulk and output the text and the second to format the text onto a single line.</p>
<p>The scripts can be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/Or0ch1/Scripts">Or0ch1</a></p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/pyscript.png" alt="morse"></p>
<p>One huge problem i faced was how the program was reading the files randomly so for an hour i was stuck trying to decode text that was in the wrong order.I fixed this by using the nasorted python library.</p>
<p>The text gotten was shifted using ROT13 and it was also reversed so i used this online decoder <a href="https://rot13.com/">ROT13</a> and got the flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/Rot.png" alt="morse">
<img src="https://or0ch1.tech/knightctf/code.png" alt="morse"></p>
<p>I really hope you enjoyed the read, as im sure most can tell this is my first time writing a writeup ðŸ˜‚ but i hope to get better with time.</p>
<p>Happy hacking everyone ðŸ˜Ž and as we say at f334aks-mini #IWDWD ðŸ’€</p>
